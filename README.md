Exploratory data analysis of household electricity usage: a case study on solar electricity generation, with/without solar battery combination and electricity from electricity providers.

Exploratory household electricity consumption analysis focuses on solar-generated power and the potential benefits of incorporating a battery system. Naomi's solar panels reduce her reliance on the grid, but she's considering a battery to store excess energy. Our analysis evaluates cost savings under two scenarios: conservative 4% annual electricity price increase and Naomi's 4.25% estimate due to climate concerns.

We validate data, visualize trends, calculate grid electricity, surplus solar power, model battery charge, and estimate potential savings for 2020. This analysis gives Naomi insights into her cost reduction potential and aids her decision-making process regarding sustainable energy choices.
